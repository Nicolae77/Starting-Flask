     <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
     <h3>Cloud computing has been used in IT industry for many years. Cloud computing is a
      remote, virtual pool of on-demand, shared resourses that can be rapidly deployed at 
      scale. In other words, cloud computing is a virtual PC which is in the cloud provider's 
      data center that can be used as  a physical PC(Personal Computer).
      <img src="./static/assets/images/cloud_computing.png" alt=""> <br>
      The most common services offered by cloud providers are: Compute Power and Storage.<br>
      <u>Compute power</u> - how much processing the computer can do. For example, when we buy a computer,
       we choose it with 8Gb RAM and an i5 CPU. Using several tasks at the same time we will see 
       that our PC experiences difficulties. With cloud computing we can add or remove  compute power as much as we want.<br>
      <u>Storage</u> - is the amount of data that can be stored in our computer. Any electronic device has its data storage limit.
        With cloud computing we can request storage as much as we want. <br> <br>
      Cloud computing is based on virtualization. Virtualization allows you to create multiple 
      virtual machines or VMs, where all of them run on single server. Each of VM has it's own
       operating system and set of applications. VMs are created by Hypervisor. Hypervisor is a
        software used to create the virtualized environment which is located between physical 
        hardware and the virtual machines, to create a share pool of virtual hardware resources.
        Virtual machines are also called instance or server.
     </h3>
     <img src="./static/assets/images/hypervisor.png" alt=""> <br>
     <h3><u>The benefits of virtualization are:</u> <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy share resources - Virtualization makes it much easier for many
        different people to share the same hardware. On VM you can run Windows or Linux operating systems.
      </li>
      <li>Less waste - Most computers are not constantly running 100% utilization.
        Right now your PC probably using a small fraction of it's CPU and memory to run this web page.
         Virtualization gives you access to previously unused resources.
      </li>
      <li>Lower costs - Virtualization enables better use of physical resources, which increases
         agility and enables IT flexibility and scalability. In this way it is possible to reduce
          operating expenses, as well as maintenance  of physical hardware.</li>
          <li>More environmentaly friendly - Less hardware that need to be manufactured and less 
            power consumed which means that virtualization helps promote green computing.</li>
    </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Cloud Types.</h2>
    <h3>There are 3 types of cloud Computing, such as: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Public</li>
      <li>Private</li>
      <li>Hybrid</li>
    </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>Each cloud offers a different level of management, security, and resilience.</h3>
    <h3><u>Public Cloud</u> is a collection of virtual, on-demand service that are offered to the public.
       The vendor rent out it's hardware to many different customers. Customers can use what they want when they need it.
       Resources provided by vendor are accessible from anywhere, as long as you have internet connection. All backend 
       maintenence, including power, cooling, upgrades, and repairs are handled by the cloud vendor . The customers will
        never see the hardware which they are using.
      </h3>
      <h3><u>Private Cloud</u> is similar to a public cloud, but the main difference is that the resources are not offered to the public.
      Everything is hosted, managed and owned by the company. This allows for direct control over resources.
      </h3>
      <h3><u>Hybrid Cloud</u> is a combination of private and public cloud.</h3>
      <h2>Cloud Concepts.</h2>
      <h3>Cloud computing has a few key characteristics that allows it to become the powerful service that it is today, such as: <br>
      <ul>
        <li><u>On demand resourcing</u> - This means that when you want to provision a resources within the cloud, it's almost immediately available to you. 
          You allocate them when and where you need them. There's no more waiting around for hardware to be ordered, installed, and 
          configure before you can use it.
        </li>
        <li><u>Consumption-based</u> You only pay for what you use. If you are running a server for two hours and then you 
        shut it down, you gonna pay only for those hours.
      </li>
      <li><u>Sclability and Agibility</u> Cloud computing offers you the ability to rapidly scale your environment's
      resources. It depends of the requirements and the demands of your application and services. When scaling up and down 
      you altering the power and performance of a particular instance.
      </li>
      <li><u>Economy of Scale</u> Public cloud vendors can procure hardware for much cheaper than market price.
      Also, it's simply more economical to create and run large public cloud data centers, rather than having each company with its own on premises.
      </li>
      <li><u>High available</u> Many of the core services on the public cloud are replicated across different geographic zones and
      regions. When one zone goes down you can usually switch to another. In this way you can ensure the durability of your data and the availability of your services.
      </li>
      <li><u>Security</u> Public cloud vendors are considered to be more secure than your own data center. The main vendors operate at an exceptional
      high standard of security.</li>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Cloud Service Models.</h2>
    <h3>There are a few services available in the cloud computing. These services can be grouped into a few different models such as: <br>
    <ul>
      <li><u>IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)</u> - These services gives you the option of architecting your own virtual data center. 
      You can start out by configuring a virtual network with routers, firewalls, and private IP address ranges. As an example could be: AWS(Amazon Web Server and Microsoft Azure).</li>
      <li><u>Paas(Platform as a Service)</u> - Offers a greater level of control, but it requires more setup.
        You can access the Operating System, but not change it.
        Ex: Google App Engine, Heroku.</li>
      <li><u>SaaS(Software as a Service)</u> Offers ready to use applications. Users can simply access the application over the internet.
        You can access software over the internet, but you can't change it.
      Such as: Google gmail, Microsoft Office, or other applications.</li>
    </ul>
